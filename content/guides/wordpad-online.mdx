WordPad is one of the most familiar text editors on Windows — lightweight, fast, and straightforward. If you are looking for a way to use WordPad online, directly in your browser, this page is for you.

## What is Online WordPad?

Online WordPad is a free, browser-based word processor that works like the classic Windows WordPad application — but without needing to install anything. It runs entirely in your browser on any device: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, or iPad.

You can open the editor, start typing, format your text, and export your document — all without creating an account or downloading software.

## What Can You Do With WordPad Online?

WordPad Online gives you all the features you expect from a word processor:

- **Rich text formatting** — bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font families, font sizes, text color, and highlight color
- **Tables** — insert tables with a visual grid picker, add or remove rows and columns, resize cells
- **Images** — paste or upload images and resize them inline
- **Page breaks** — insert real page breaks that work in print
- **Export** — download your document as Word (.docx), HTML, or plain text (.txt)
- **Print** — print with configurable page margins (0.5 cm to 2 cm)
- **Command menu** — type `/` anywhere to insert headings, lists, tables, and more
- **Auto-save** — your document is automatically saved in your browser

## How to Use WordPad Online

1. Click **Start Writing** to open the editor instantly
2. Type your document and format it using the toolbar or the `/` command menu
3. Use **File → Export** to download as .docx, .html, or .txt
4. Use **File → Print** or press `Ctrl+P` to print

No sign-up. No download. No waiting.

## Is It Really Free?

Yes — completely free. No ads, no paywalls, no premium tiers. Online WordPad is an independent open-source project.

## Does It Work Offline?

Once the page has loaded, editing works completely offline. Your document is saved automatically to your browser's local storage, so it persists across page refreshes.

## Who Is It For?

Online WordPad is ideal for:

- Students writing notes or reports on shared or school computers
- Users on Windows 11 where WordPad has been removed
- Anyone who needs a quick document editor without installing Microsoft Word
- People working on Chromebooks or Mac without a Windows license
