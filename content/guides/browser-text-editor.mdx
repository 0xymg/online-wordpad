A browser text editor is a word processor that runs entirely inside your web browser — no installation, no downloads, and no account required. You open a URL and start typing.

## Why Use a Browser Text Editor?

Browser-based text editors have several advantages over desktop software:

- **Works on any device** — Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, iPad, or any device with a modern browser
- **No installation** — useful on shared or managed computers where you cannot install software
- **No license cost** — no Microsoft 365 subscription needed
- **Always up to date** — no manual updates required
- **Private** — if data stays in your browser (not sent to a server), your documents remain private
