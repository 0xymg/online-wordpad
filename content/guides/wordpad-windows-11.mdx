In September 2023, Microsoft officially removed WordPad from Windows 11 with the Windows 11 23H2 update. After more than 28 years, the built-in word processor is gone — and millions of users are looking for a replacement.

## Why Was WordPad Removed?

Microsoft's official statement says WordPad is a "deprecated" feature and users should use **Notepad** for plain text or **Microsoft Word** for rich text documents. However, many users relied on WordPad as a lightweight middle ground — something more capable than Notepad but less complex than Word.

## The Best Free WordPad Replacements

### 1. Online WordPad (Browser-Based — No Install)

**[Online WordPad](/)** is a free browser-based word processor that works like the original WordPad — but runs in your browser on any device.

**Why it is the best replacement:**
- No download or installation needed
- Works on Windows 11, Windows 10, Mac, Linux, and Chromebooks
- Rich text formatting: bold, italic, underline, font sizes, text color
- Insert tables, images, and page breaks
- Export to Word (.docx), HTML, or plain text (.txt)
- Print with configurable margins
- Completely free, no account required

[Open Online WordPad](/pad) — it works instantly in your browser.

### 2. LibreOffice Writer (Desktop)

A full desktop office suite, free and open source. More powerful than WordPad but requires a ~300MB download and installation.

### 3. Google Docs (Online)

Google's word processor requires a Google account. Good for collaboration but not ideal for quick offline editing.

### 4. Notepad++ (Text Editor)

A powerful plain text editor for developers. Lacks rich text formatting — not a true WordPad replacement for document writing.

## What Features Did WordPad Have?

The original Windows WordPad supported:
- Bold, italic, underline formatting
- Font families and font sizes
- Text and background color
- Bulleted lists
- Insert images
- Save as .rtf, .docx, or .txt
- Print support

Online WordPad matches all of these features and adds tables, page breaks, a command menu, emoji, and export to HTML.

## How to Open a .rtf File Without WordPad

If you have old `.rtf` files that WordPad used to open, you can:

1. Open them in **Online WordPad** by pasting the content
2. Use LibreOffice Writer (free download)
3. Rename the file to `.doc` and open in Google Docs
