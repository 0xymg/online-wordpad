### 2. Google Docs

A full-featured open-source office suite. LibreOffice Writer is the most capable free desktop word processor and an excellent WordPad alternative for power users.

**Drawback:** ~300MB download. Not suitable for quick editing or shared computers.

### 4. WPS Office Free

A Microsoft Office-compatible suite with a free tier. Good compatibility with .docx files.

**Drawback:** Contains ads in the free version.
